🧑‍🎓I completed the Full Stack Open 2020, after 9 parts, 197 exercises, 118 hours. The main focus is on building applications with #ReactJS and Node.js.

<b>Three good things about the course </b> (my opinion):

1. Updated: No more deprecate courses, you get updated information and by University of Helsinki.
2. Documentation first: You will have to dive deeper in documentations and other resources to find out solutions, this could be a little hard at the beginning but, your problem solving and information seeking skills will grow.
3. Job interview: If you complete the course with full credits, and complete the practical work with 10 credits, you get a job interview with their partners. (You need to be a resident of Finland in order to participate in these interviews).
